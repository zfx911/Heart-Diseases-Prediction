# Heart-Diseases-Prediction

Heart disease is a significant global health concern, responsible for a substantial number of deaths.Understanding the intricate factors that contribute to heart disease is crucial for improving public health outcomes. This machine learning project seeks to unravel some potential factors that affect heart disease, aiming to uncover insights that can lead to better prevention. 

The aim of this project is to predict whether there is a potential risk of heart disease based on the patient's physical indicators. The project will compare the performance of multiple classification models and select the best model to predict the potential heart diseases based on patient's body indicators.
